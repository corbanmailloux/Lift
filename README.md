Lift
====

A simple Android app that asks one question: "Did you lift today?"

This app keeps track of whether or not you lifted today and provides additional features such as your current streak, your best streak, and a gym locator in case you haven't lifted (weak).

The app can be downloaded on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.corb.dylt).

A web version of the app is now available at [http://lift.corb.co](http://lift.corb.co).
