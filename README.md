Lift
====

A simple Android app that asks one question: "Did you lift today?"

This app keeps track of whether or not you lifted today, and provides additional features such as your current streak, your best streak, and a gym locator in case you haven't lifted (weak).

The app can be downloaded [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.corb.dylt) on the Google Play Store.
